# Introduction to Exam Seating Plan Project

## Overview
Welcome to the Exam Seating Plan project! In this group project, we, *Muhammad Rameez* and *Mehtab Haider*, will be collaborating to develop a CLI Exam Seating Plan system using C++ programming language.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to create a software solution that automates the process of generating and managing seating arrangements for exams. Our system aims to streamline tasks such as seating plan generation, and conflict resolution, thereby enhancing the efficiency and fairness of the exam administration process.

## Objectives
- Develop user-friendly interfaces for students and administrators to register for exams and manage seating arrangements.
- Implement algorithms to automatically generate seating plans while considering factors like student spacing and conflict resolution.
- Ensure data security and integrity by implementing authentication, authorization, and data backup mechanisms.
- Provide scalability and performance optimizations to handle a large volume of concurrent users and exams.
- Collaborate effectively as a group to divide tasks, implement features, and ensure timely project delivery.
